# Kattis
This repository is a collection of Kattis problems that I have attempted or finished when I practice problem solving on [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/).
I like to practice on Kattis because of how simple and easy the judging software is made. It is quite relaxing and fun to complete these complicated questions but it is also good practice and a nice way to continuously hone my ability to make scalable respurce concious programs.
I use Java for most of my solutions primarily because its fun and easy. I enjoy Java but I will switch to python or C if necessary to complete a problem.
